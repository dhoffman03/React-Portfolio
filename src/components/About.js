                    Hey there! My name is Dymond. I am currently a student of UofM Coding Bootcamp. I am still new to coding and have just started my web development journey. I am eager to expand my coding skills and become a professional web developer.When I'm not coding, you can find me painting, working with clay, or napping with my cats.
